# IOT Smart Plant Monitoring and Irrigation System Project # 

Brief: 

- An IoT smart plant monitoring and irrigation system is a technology that helps people monitor and water their plants using the internet. The system includes sensors that measure factors like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, and then sends that information to the firebase that can be accessed online. Users can then check on their plants 
remotely, and the system can even water the plants automatically based on the data collected by the sensors. 

- There are many different types of smart plant monitoring and irrigation systems available, ranging from DIY projects like this project that use basic components, to commercial products that are designed specifically for agriculture. These systems can be a great way to keep plants healthy, even if the user is not able to be physically present to care for them.
